            <h2>Alma 1 41:11</h2>
            <p>And now, my son, all men that are in a state of anature,
                 or I would say, in a bcarnal state, are in the cgall of 
                 bitterness and in the dbonds of iniquity; they are ewithout 
                 God in the world, and they have gone fcontrary to the nature
                  of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature 
                  of happiness.</p>

                And also, ye yourselves will asuccor those that
                 stand in need of your succor; ye will administer 
                 of your substance unto him that standeth in need; 
                 and ye will not suffer that the bbeggar putteth up his 
                 petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.
