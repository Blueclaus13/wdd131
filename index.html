                <h2>Raramuris, an emblematic culture from Chihuahua</h2>
                <p>In March 29th, 2024 a group of six women ran in the Speed project ultramarathon of 540km. 
                    It became in Santa Monita 4am to Las vegas. They made 72 hours in relays. People from 
                    US noticed that they wore the typical dress to run. Raramuries are proud of their roots. Their 
                    story is a life of fight. less than 200 years ago, they were fighting for their lands against
                     people looking for gold or just the land. They are winners of resistance, the weather has been 
                     difficult in the places they live which affects agriculture. There are times when they have 
                     to run long distances to reach for food or communities because they live up in the mountains.
                      We are proud of them because they used their struggles as their strength. 
                </p>
                <p>There is also a document in Netflix named "lorena light footed woman". 
                    Raramuri means "light footer". She is a stronger woman running in many places
                     with his family. There is a scene where Nike shoes gift her a pair of sneakers 
                     and she says "The people who use them run behind me". That makes me smile because 
                     it's true. I usually say them "all-terrain" like the pickup wheels because with their 
                     feet they walk any kind of land and they arrive faster than I do.</p>
                <p>
                    The runners of Rarámuri origin are from the Sierra Tarahumara, 
                    a mountain range in northwestern Mexico that forms part of the Barrancas del Cobre (Copper Canyon).
                    It's a great place to visit because it's fresh aire and nice. The place where they live and their story 
                    is an example of how Chihuahua is built. People who use the difficult to become them strengths.
